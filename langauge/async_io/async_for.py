"""
See langauge.statements_expressions.statements.iteration_protocol

Now you ask: what happens if you declare the __next__() special method as an async def coroutine function? That will
allow it to await some kind of I/O-bound operationâ€”and this is pretty much exactly how async for works

1. You must implement def __aiter__(). (Note: not with async def!)
2. __aiter__() must return an object that implements async def __anext__().
3. __anext__() must return a value for each iteration and raise StopAsyncIteration when finished.

async for provides the ability to retain the convenience of a simple for loop, even when iterating over data where
the iteration itself is performing I/O. The benefit is that you can process enormous amounts of data with a single
loop, because you have to deal with each chunk only in tiny batches """
