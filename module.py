# In simple terms, every file of Python source code whose name ends in a .py extension is a module.
# Each module file is a package of variables—that is, a namespace.

Indentation

Python doesn’t care how you indent (you may use either spaces or tabs), or how much you indent (you may use any number of spaces or tabs). In fact, the indentation of one nested block can be totally different from that of another.
The syntax rule is only that for a given single nested block, all of its statements must be indented the same distance to the right. If this is not the case, you will get a syntax error, and your code will not run until you repair its indentation to be consistent.
As a rule of thumb, you probably shouldn’t mix tabs and spaces in the same block in Python, unless you do so consistently; use tabs or spaces in a given block, but not both
